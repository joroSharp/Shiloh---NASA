**_VÍDEO DE CÓMO FUNCIONA LA APLICACIÓN_** 

**_2.- Provide a high-level summary of your project_**

**_Shiloh_** is a **_virtual partner_** capable of **_interpret_** your **_emotions_** and your **_words_**. **_It learns_** from people's **_experiences_** to **_provide you with support, advice and positive thoughts_** when you need them most.

**_3.- how your project addresses this challenge_**

**_Problem addressed_**
**_Shiloh_** exists to avoid social loneliness in today's confinement times. **_People_** of the world are more **_isolated_** now than ever, despite being in the age of communication. Even being surrounded by millions of people, we are not able to fill our need of socialization, **_of feeling part of a group_** .

- **_6,000,000 people_** are **_isolated_** currently.
- **_social networks_** allow you to express but **_not to communicate_**, people need to speak, ask and listen.
- The **_human beings are social_**, they need to guide and be guided. they also need self-care and take care of others.
- **_NASA_** already has mechanisms to improve the quality of sleep and light in space, but **_it needs to move fowards_** in the remaining points that affect **_isolation_**.

4.- **_How did you develop your project?_**
Currently **_there are already text interpreters_** and conversations that identify your keywords. We, through **_Shiloh_**, have taken one **_more step_**.

Thanks to the AI ​​of **_Shiloh_** we create a **_real conversation_** that is based on the **_previous experiences_** of the user himself along with the ones of the millions of **_users around the world_**.

We have designed an **_interpreter_** in which the identification of the **_feelings_** and the **_keywords_** is referenced. Through this, we are able to add them in a variable that will then be uploaded to the database. Example:

**_My mother_** was **_hungry_** but did not know what to eat.

![](https://github.com/joroSharp/Shiloh---NASA/blob/master/3.-%20Idea/Analisis.png)

* Mother -> Family
* My -> Possessive
* Hunger -> Problem

![](https://github.com/joroSharp/Shiloh---NASA/blob/master/3.-%20Idea/Shiloh.png)

**_Shiloh_** **_identifies_** that is a **_problem_** from **_past_** of a **_family member_**. It saves the information and return a solution for a similar future case.

As we can see in the previous example, **_we identify_** an **_emotion_**, the **_subject_** affected, the **_problem_** and the **_time_** if it is past, present, future. With this we adapt the **_solution_** of another user who went through something similar and how he overcame the situation. Thus creating a **_positive conversation_** that provides **_bonding and commitment_**.

Synchronous:

1. Shiloh's interaction with the person through conversation.
2. Interpretation of the user's emotions.
3. Identification of keywords and context. Analysis of the situation.
4. Searching of the most viable solution through its record.
5. Continue the conversation with the person offering closeness.

Asynchronous:

6. After analyzing the current situation, once you interpret the resolution of the problem, it will be uploaded to the Internet for other users.
7. Periodically, new situations will be downloaded as well as the update of the best solutions.


**_5.- Show your solution_**

We present **_Shiloh_**, a **_virtual partner_** that **_covers_** the **_social_** need of **_communication_**. The more we talk, the more **_it learns_** from the **_experiences_** of all the users. It is able to **_interpret_** the most common **_feelings_** and it is **_interested_** in your daily progress.

**_It offers solutions_** that have been useful to other people who have lived the same situations or it searches for answers in decisions that you have previously made. Similarly, **_it allows you to guide_** other people with **_your experiences_**.

**_Shiloh_** **_unites us_** all even if we are alone.


**_Value proposition for users_**
Users will be able to **_share_** their **_experiences_** with the rest of the world and to learn from them through **_Shiloh_**. Thanks to this, **_Shiloh will create_** a **_relationship_** of **_interest_** and concern through the interpretation of the words and emotions of the user. In addition, **_it will create a biography_** of each one to keep an **_evolution of their life_**.

**_Value proposition for NASA_**
Thanks to **_anonymous global data_**, it will allow you to know those **_most common situations_** that are lived in a society in confinement, how it affects the lack of communication or the **_day-to-day problems_**, in addition to the **_most optimal solutions_** for most users. In this way they will be able to implement it, for example, in **_future space missions_** or investigations in remote places.

**_Who are our users?_**
**_Shiloh_** is not only intended for **_people_** who are isolated, but also for all those who **_need to be heard or want to share_** how they feel. Machines don't usually convey that sense of company and **_Shiloh_** tries to break that barrier, **_getting even closer_** and becoming **_part of a group_**.

**_How do we maintain customer engagement?_**
- **_Interaction_** with the user that **_encourages communication_**.
- It will be based on **_short interactions_** unless the user decides to continue sharing their experiences.
- The more you interact, the more people will share the problem or solution with you. It will make you feel part of something bigger.
